# Number to Greek Word Converter

## First version:

This program is a simple C program that converts a given numeric input into words, specifically into Greek words.

### Updated version improvements:

1. Modularization: The code has been modularized into separate functions, each responsible for a specific task, such as getting the number of digits, reversing digits, printing categories, and printing the number in words.
2. Meaningful Variable Names: Variable names have been made more descriptive, making the code easier to understand.
3. Constants: Magic numbers have been replaced with meaningful constants, improving code readability and maintainability.
4. Enum for Categories: An enum has been introduced to represent categories of numbers (million, thousand, hundred), improving code readability and reducing the chance of errors.
5. Input Validation: The code now includes basic input validation to handle negative numbers correctly.
6. Clear Output: The output is clear and follows a consistent format, making it easy to understand the converted number.
7. Improved Readability: The code has been formatted consistently and includes comments to explain complex logic and provide context where necessary.
8. Separation of Concerns: Each function has a single responsibility, improving code maintainability and making it easier to debug and extend.
9. Error Handling: While basic, the code includes error handling for negative numbers, ensuring that the program behaves predictably.
10. Reduced Hardcoding: Hardcoded strings and numbers have been replaced with dynamically generated output, making the code more flexible and reusable.
11. Simplified Logic: Unnecessary complexity has been removed, making the code more straightforward and easier to follow.
12. Refactored Data Structures: Arrays of category names and digit names have been refactored into 2D arrays for better organization and readability.
